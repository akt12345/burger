# Burger Application
## Overview
I created a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. Handlebars generated my HTML.

* Restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name,  app displays the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* Stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
